# Contributing to Archie üíñ

First off, thank you for considering contributing to **Archie (the EPFL AI Assistant for Architecture)**! We're really excited that you're interested in helping out. Whether you're fixing a typo, suggesting a new feature, reporting a bug, or writing code, your contribution is valuable and greatly appreciated.

This project is for the EPFL community, and we believe that collaboration makes it better. We want contributing to **Archie** to be a positive and straightforward experience.

This document provides some simple guidelines to help you get started. Don't worry if you're new to contributing; we're happy to help!

## How Can I Contribute? ü§î

There are many ways you can contribute, and all are welcome:

* **Reporting Bugs:** If you find something in **Archie** that's not working as expected.
* **Suggesting Enhancements:** If you have an idea for a new feature for **Archie** or an improvement to an existing one.

No contribution is too small!

## Reporting Bugs üêû

If you encounter a bug, please let us know by opening an issue on GitHub.

Before creating a new issue, it's helpful to quickly check if a similar one already exists.

When reporting a bug, please try to include:

* A clear and descriptive title (e.g., "Archie fails to find editors for application X").
* A description of the problem: What did you do? What did you expect to happen? What actually happened?
* Steps to reproduce the issue, if possible.
* Information about your environment (e.g., browser version, operating system) if relevant.

Providing these details helps us understand and fix the issue faster.

## Suggesting Enhancements ‚ú®

Have a great idea for **Archie**? We'd love to hear it! Please open an issue on GitHub to suggest enhancements or new features.

When suggesting an enhancement:

* Use a clear and descriptive title (e.g., "Suggestion: Allow Archie to query business capabilities").
* Explain your idea: What would you like to see added or changed?
* Explain why this enhancement would be useful for EPFL users or the project.

## Your First Code Contribution (Pull Requests) üßë‚Äçüíª

If you'd like to contribute code to **Archie**, that's fantastic! Here‚Äôs a gentle guide to submitting a Pull Request (PR):

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own copy of the **Archie** project on GitHub.
2.  **Create a Branch:** Make a new branch in your fork for your changes (e.g., `feature/archie-widget` or `fix/readme-typo`). This keeps your changes organized.
3.  **Make Your Changes:** Write your code or make your documentation improvements.
4.  **Test Your Changes:** If you're adding code, please try to ensure it works as expected. (We aim to add automated tests later!)
5.  **Commit Your Changes:** Use clear and descriptive commit messages (e.g., "Fix: Correct editor lookup logic in Archie" or "Feat: Add button for Y").
6.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your changes to your branch on your forked repository.
7.  **Open a Pull Request:** Go to the original **Archie** repository on GitHub and open a Pull Request from your branch to the main project branch (usually `main` or `master`).
8.  **Describe Your PR:** Briefly explain the changes you've made and why. If it relates to an existing issue, please link it (e.g., "Closes #123").

Once you've submitted your PR, one of the project maintainers will review it. We might suggest some changes or improvements, or ask questions. We aim to be constructive and helpful during reviews!

## Code Style and Conventions üé®

We primarily use Python for the backend (Azure Functions). We try to follow standard Python conventions (like PEP 8). If linters or formatters are configured for the project (e.g., Black, Flake8), please try to run them before committing.

For the frontend (React/Vue/Angular - TBD), we'll establish conventions as we go.

The most important thing is clear, readable code. Don't stress too much about minor style points initially; we can always tidy things up during review.
